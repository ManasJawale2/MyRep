        Analytical chemistry is another critical branch, focusing on the analysis of material samples to determine their chemical composition and structure. Techniques such as chromatography, spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry are commonly used in analytical chemistry. This field is vital for environmental testing, quality control in manufacturing, clinical diagnostics, and forensic science. <br> <br>
        Biochemistry, a sub-discipline of both biology and chemistry, explores the chemical processes within and related to living organisms. It involves the study of enzymes, DNA/RNA, and metabolic pathways. <br> <br> Biochemistry is fundamental to medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms of life and enabling the development of new therapeutic strategies. <br> <br>

        At the core of chemistry lies the study of atomic structure. Atoms, the basic units of chemical elements, consist of a nucleus containing protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons in defined shells. The periodic table organizes elements by increasing atomic number, grouping them into vertical columns (groups) that share chemical properties and horizontal rows (periods) that have the same number of electron shells. This organization helps predict the behavior of elements in chemical reactions <br> <br>
        Chemical bonding is a key concept in chemistry, describing how atoms combine to form molecules. Ionic bonds result from the transfer of electrons from one atom to another, while covalent bonds involve the sharing of electrons between atoms. Metallic bonds, characterized by delocalized electrons shared among a lattice of metal atoms, give metals their characteristic properties. Understanding these bonds is crucial for explaining the structure and properties of substances. <br> <br>
        Chemical reactions involve the transformation of reactants into products, with various types such as synthesis, decomposition, single replacement, double replacement, and combustion. Reactions can be endothermic, absorbing energy, or exothermic, releasing energy. Catalysts are substances that speed up chemical reactions without being consumed in the process, playing a vital role in industrial processes and biological systems. <br> <br>
        The states of matter—solids, liquids, gases, and plasmas—each have distinct properties. Solids have a definite shape and volume, with particles arranged in a fixed structure. Liquids have a definite volume but no fixed shape, with particles that can move past each other. Gases have neither a definite shape nor volume, with particles that move freely and are far apart. Plasmas, ionized gases with free electrons and ions, conduct electricity and are found in phenomena like the sun and lightning. <br> <br>
        Chemical equilibrium and kinetics are fundamental concepts in understanding how chemical reactions proceed. Chemical equilibrium occurs when the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction, resulting in no net change in the concentrations of reactants and products. Le Chatelier's principle states that a system at equilibrium will adjust to counteract any changes imposed on it. Reaction kinetics studies the speed of chemical reactions and the factors affecting it, such as concentration, temperature, surface area, and the presence of catalysts. <br> <br>
