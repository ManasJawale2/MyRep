# Now are about to learn about while loops
# for i in range (3):
#     print(i)
# i = int(input("Enter the Number: "))
# while(i<=38):
#     print(i)
#     i+=1
# While loop's body's actins happens while the bool inside while is false

# print ("Im done with the loop")

count = 5

while(count > 0):
    print(count)
    count-=1
# We can even use else if here
else:
    print("Im done")
# Warning : This is be countinoud untill it will be false so dont make a infinite loop
# while(true) like this

# There s one more thing
# its do while loop
# Unfortunatly it is not supported by pythonðŸ¥º
